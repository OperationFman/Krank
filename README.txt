# Meal Roulette + FX Converter

Basic webapp built by and for Franklin and Keegan

Simply handles two of our LARGEST problems:
-What to have for dinner
-Converting currency and keeping a record

This is a micro-stack using Python with the flask framework, 
leaning heavily on the book 'Head First Python'

Install:
1. Download or clone
2. Make sure you have python 3.8 or higher installed with PATH setup
3. Open that directory in commandline or powershell (Shift click in the folder, click 'open in powershell')
4. Run command: 'python krank2web.py'
5. Navigate to 127.0.0.1:5000
6. Done, you now have your own setup, the database probably wont work and 
   I have no idea how to set that up yet
